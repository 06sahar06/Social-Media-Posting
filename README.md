# Social Media APIs for Posting, Scheduling, and Analytics

This repository is forked from Ayrshare's official repository for social media posting, it's been tested on Linkedin through a new python file: test.py with additional integration of streamlit.
The obtained interface would take as input a text to post alongside with an image if it's desired to be posted.
It then publishes the post on Linkedin (or other social media when needed)
